Greetings,
My name's Ahmet and my student number is S3865010. On this personal website, I would like to tell you about where I came from, how I ventured into the world of Information Technology and what my intentions and project are.

I was born in 1987 in Istanbul, Turkey. After graduating from high school, I've decided to visit other parts of the world and learn new things from different people. Before arriving in Australia in 2006, I studied the Russian language in Ukraine. I'm fluent in Turkish, proficient in English and I speak basic Russian.

A data is stored information. Information Technology is the combination of techniques and methods of creating and manipulating data. From calculators to satellites, information flows through every aspect of our lives. Accessible and transmittable information makes our lives easier and faster.

My first interaction with a data device was when I was in kindergarten back in 1992. My uncle who is a computer technician assembled our first personal computer and brought a box of empty floppy disks. The operating system of the computer was MSDOS 4.0 and the only peripheral it had was a monitor, keyboard and a floppy disk drive. Being able to load and unload games and texts was my first experience with customising a data storage device. Entering lines of codes into the command bar was my first data processing experience.

When computers were first invented, they were used only by governmental organisations and large corporations. From the early 90s to today, I was lucky to be able to witness the development of computer hardware, software and their integration into our lives in almost every step.

Being raised by white-collared parents, I've studied Business up to Certificate 4 of TAFE level and worked usually in an office environment and rarely in field areas. I've always had a plan to turn my childhood passion into skills but didn't have the spare time. During the unfortunate events of 2020, I was able to find the opportunity to immerse myself in the world of IT and I observed that from now on, people and organisations will be more involved with smartphones and computers.

I was usually educated in classrooms however, with the procedures of the pandemic the only available method for me to study was online. I've met the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology through Open Universities Australia. After making research on the web, I learned that despite being young, RMIT is a research university that quickly climbed up through the list of top universities in Oceania and the world. (1) Reading public reviews of people who studied and graduated from RMIT also encouraged me to choose it.

The Bachelor's of IT provided by RMIT enables a student to become knowledgeable and capable in a wide area of the world of computers. Information Technology is a broad field and I aim to learn every subject to the best of my abilities to become a self-sufficient and productive IT expert.

After graduation, I aim to work with relevant individuals and companies to gain experience and study Master's degree in Computer Science. My education plan is to take my degree to the highest level and to become an academic instructor in Turkey, to educate new generations in computers and programs. 

Besides IT, I enjoy reading about cosmology. I'm learning about physics, astronomy, astrophysics as much as I can to become an academician like Max Tegmark(3). I dream to participate in software development projects that can simulate the universe and expand our knowledge about it.

### Ideal Job

As a mature age student, I intend to undertake a master's degree after bachelors' and become an instructor in an instituition to share my skills and knowledge with younger students in the future. This job position is an example of my plan of work after graduation. It provides the opportunity to become a colleague with academicians and prospective students. It also presents the priviledge of meeting new students from different backgrounds in every next study period.

The Master's degree in Information Technology or Computer Science is a clear indication of the high expertise necessary to undertake this job. Clear communication and effective teaching skills is also required to provide an education with precision. Obtaining three refference letters from different proffesional refferees would be able only after working in the relevant field and raising succesful students.

Working in the office environment provided me many opportunities to form teams with colleagues and perpetual communication to clarify our goals. Learning different languages at an early stage of my life motivated me to enrich my vocabulary which will be useful in the academic field.

After obtaining my Bachelor's, I intend to take side courses and work as intern teacher in private organisations to gain teaching skills and experience. This may take several years but it will enable me to learn from experienced instructors. I also plan to work as a private teacher to gain one on one teaching skills and boost my experience. 

### Personal Profile

Personality, creativity and learning tests provided me an overlook at my strengths and weaknesses. Reading the results increased my self-awarenes and helped me to discover points in myself that I haven't noticed before. Following the advice of the experts who prepared these tests will be my first priority to enhance my strengths and mitigate my weaknesses.

![Myers-Briggs Test Result](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90659029/133961906-989a6bb9-7e1a-4cae-bfa6-310f45a8fd03.JPG)

According to the result of Myers-Briggs Personality Test above, I have a balanced personality between an extravert & introvert, thinker & feeler and judging & prospecting. Being 70% intiuitive & 30% observant and 80% assertive & 20% turbulent on top puts me into a mediator category. Putting these traits to use in a team work, I can maintain the communication and the relation between team members. This would prevent miscommunication and conflict in the team to develop further and provide a stable progress. Being a mediator can also help me to do the bridging tasks between the team leader and the team members.

![Creativity Test Result](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90659029/133961999-bb4736ed-5ea9-4c28-a8d7-e6b20d938c12.JPG)

Being mostly intuitive, I should be mindful when and where to present alternatives and suggestions. The learning test of PersonalityMax shows that I should develop my auditory learning style. During phone conversations for instance, I must pay extra attention to what other parties are saying. Finally, the result of the creativity test I provided shows that my creativity is more concentrated on curiousity and persistentence. These two tratits would help me to find more effective soultions and show my team better ways to follow.

### Project Idea

What Hard Ware or WHW is a website, a pc program and a smartphone application that will assist potential buyers to choose the optimal computer hardware to run the program they have in mind. After entering the information about program type, settings and budget it will make a list of the hardware they can use to achieve the results the user desires. The application will also provide weblinks about whom to buy the hardware from with the best price. This application will be a versatile guide for people with little knowledge to professionals who are experts in their fields.

Hardware and software are intertwined and as they develop so do the needs of people and organisations. It is in everybody's nature to make research before purchasing a product. Due to contradicting information on the web, not all researches bring the most precise results. This often leads to people choosing the wrong products or spending more money than they should. As return policies are becoming stricter every day people realise that they have bought the wrong hardware only after testing it for themselves but often lose the option to return the item they purchased. WHW will help people to avoid this frustration and bring them the best choices to choose from.

In a simple description, What Hard Ware will be similar to a complex search engine integrated into a program and an application. It will be powered by the most popular search engines and it will allow users to choose one of those engines. To conduct a search, users will enter information about what software they will use for example a title of a game or the name of a productivity program. They will also choose how smooth and fast they desire the program to be operated and WHW will show recommended hardware to achieve those results. Specifications of the hardware will be chosen based on the data collected from the web such as positive and negative comments from other users, review websites, official specifications from manufacturers and so on. If the users enter their budget it will provide shopping links with vendors selling the items within the desired price range. 

WHW will provide a simple user interface for people with basic knowledge, where they will enter only the basic parameters to receive the search results. In the next stages, it will display hints with basic information to assist basic users to narrow down their search results. For people with extensive knowledge, the program will provide an advanced user interface where they will be able to enter more detailed information and the program will find the specific hardware.

For gaming hardware, there will be sections like the title of the game, the desired display resolution, the level of graphical details and the minimum display frames per second. WHW will make an extensive search through the web and find the hardware parts that will be able to run that game in those settings. The results will be divided into two categories consisting of the minimum and recommended hardware.

For live streaming, there will be sections like streaming platform, encoder, level of visual quality, display frames per second, internet connection. The program will show results not only for the specified parameters but also for lower and higher settings to give the user a more flexible list of options.

The longest list of details will be on productivity search. Users will have to enter the type of the program, expected completion time, size of the files they will execute and so on. Making a search based on details like these will take a longer time than simpler searches but eventually, WHW will make cross-referencing based on the information on the web and provide the most accurate results in the shortest time possible.

All these operations will require the arduous work of gathering information for each hardware available on the markets. The database will need to be constantly updated by gathering as much information on the web as possible to provide the users with the most up to date knowledge. Placing unintrusive advertisements throughout the application and its website will create a financial income to pay for expenditures like maintenance and development. Making commission agreements with manufacturers and vendors will also boost the financial income of the project. In search parameters, there will be an optional section of the location where users will enter the information about their country of residence to receive regional search results along with the global ones.

Users will also have the option to create accounts to keep their search operations saved for future use. Depending on their preference, they will receive promotional and advertising emails to be notified of the latest developments in the hardware world and offer from vendors.

The main structure of this project will be built by developing its search program and creating its database. Enterprise computers with high numbers of CPU cores will perform the operations of the program. A development and a maintenance team will be tasked with building and keeping these parts of the project. An internet connection with high speed and network devices with large bandwidth will be necessary to perform network operations. There will be separate and dedicated rooms for servers, data containers and network devices with suitable environmental conditions such as cooling with airconditioners. In case of a malfunction or failure, there will be a storage room with spare hardware parts to provide a replacement quickly. To avoid data loss, cloud computing services will be hired from the most reliable providers.

Before commencing the software development, extensive research must be made to choose the most appropriate programming tool. Recommendations from experts must be noted as well. Python is the most popular program to build search engines but other programming languages should be considered too. A simple domain name for the website URL must be picked and its domain should be purchased. Although liquid cooling for CPUs is the most advanced method it bears the risk of pump failure and leakage that can seriously damage the hardware. Therefore heavy-duty air coolers would be the least risky and the most cost-effective cooling solution for the CPUs. The server cases must provide the most airflow with the least dust collection. If sufficient time, adequate research and of course enough funds can be allocated this project can be completed within reachable resources.

As the project matures it must be advertised to reach the largest user base possible. Providing service with user satisfaction will increase its popularity and therefore create more opportunities in time. Individual and organisational customers will have quick access to lists of products that will meet their requirements and save time by not looking through long pages of web reviews and not watching long videos. This will upset information technology websites and social media channels that provide reviews about PC software and hardware. To gain their favour and collaboration links that lead to their websites can be included in search results. This may create a perpetually beneficial relationship for both the owners of the project and the owners of the websites and channels mentioned before.
